# Snake-Game
Snake-Game is a simple yet entertaining rendition of the classic snake game, built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Take a trip down memory lane as you control a hungry snake, maneuvering it through the grid to collect food and grow longer, all while avoiding collisions with the boundaries and yourself.
